# Advanced-DAX-Dashboard-PowerBI
Interactive Power BI dashboard built during training at Yavda using Advanced DAX functions like SELECTEDVALUE, ISFILTERED, and HASONEVALUE. Features include dynamic KPIs, top 5 product sales, and regional ranking. Focused on filter context and responsive measures.

## 📌 Project Overview
This assignment demonstrates the use of dynamic DAX measures to make the dashboard responsive to user interactions like slicers and filters.

## 🔧 My Contributions:
- I developed key dynamic DAX measures using:
- SELECTEDVALUE() – To show dynamic selections from slicers.
- ISFILTERED() – To detect applied filters in visuals.
- HASONEVALUE() – To create conditional behavior based on single or multiple values.
- These measures made our KPIs and charts adjust contextually, improving the dashboard’s interactivity and user experience.

## 📊 Key Dashboard Features:
- ✅ Top 5 Products by Sales (based on dynamic filters)
- ✅ Regional Sales Ranking
- ✅ Dynamic KPIs responsive to slicer selections
- ✅ Clean and interactive layout for better usability
